Notes:
- You can find the built mod in `%AppData%/Hephaestus/build/libs/`

- Heroku error handling isn't done yet. What this means is:
    - When entering a name for the Heroku app, make sure it is something that **shouldn't already exist**. It does not check for it, but will throw an error farther down the line.
    - You also have to make sure that you have **less than 5** Heroku apps as that is the limit.
    > If deploying to Heroku doesn't take a while (if it's quick), then you probably messed up there.


## Features
- Clean, simple and easy to use menu.
- Synchronous command execution.
- Always up-to-date R.A.T (pulls from Git repository).
- Partial error handling (external processes).
- Uses:
    - *JGit* for Git commands.
    - *Gradle Tooling API* for Gradle controls.

## Pre-requirements
- [Heroku CLI](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli) (after you install login yourself using `heroku login`)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
